                      and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.


                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context`
                      mount option.

                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the
                      same SELinux label.

                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged
                      and unprivileged Pods.

                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes,
                      and all CSI volumes

                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount:
                      true in their

                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.

                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature
                      gate is enabled.


                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption"

                      "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes

                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either
                      in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.


                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy,
                      otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when

                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.

                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and

                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1)

                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global

                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot

                        value is provided:


                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference.
                        Container creation will fail If the pull fails.

                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses
                        a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if
                        the reference isn''t present.

                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn''t
                        already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the
                        reference isn''t present and the pull fails.


                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated,
                        which means that new remote content will become available
                        on pod recreation.

                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup
                        will block containers from starting and may add significant
                        latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff
                        and will be reported on the pod reason and message.

                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are
                        defined by the container runtime implementation on a host
                        machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported
                        by the container image field.

                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath)
                        by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container
                        images.

                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable
                        files (noexec).

                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath)
                        before 1.33.

                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no
                        effect on this volume type.'

                                  Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send

                                  PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once
                                  the signer approves the

                                  request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet
                                  writes the key and

                                  certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod
                                  does not start until

                                  certificates have been issued for each podCertificate

                                  source in its spec.


                                  Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate
                                  at the time indicated

                                  by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt

                                  timestamp.


                                  Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the
                                  credentialBundlePath

                                  field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath
                                  and

                                  certificateChainPath fields.


                                  The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The
                                  first PEM

                                  entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and
                                  the remaining PEM

                                  entries are the certificate chain issued by the
                                  signer (typically,

                                  signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root
                                  order).


                                  Prefer using the credential bundle format, since
                                  your application code

                                  can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and
                                  certificateChainPath,

                                  your application must make two separate file reads.
                                  If these coincide

                                  with a certificate rotation, it is possible that
                                  the private key and leaf

                                  certificate you read may not correspond to each
                                  other.  Your application

                                  will need to check for this condition, and re-read
                                  until they are

                                  consistent.

                                  use the certificates it issues.'

                                      Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When

                                      and certificateChainPath, your application needs
                                      to check that the key

                                      The credential bundle is a single file that
                                      contains multiple PEM blocks.

                                      The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block,
                                      containing a PKCS#8 private

                                      key.


                                      The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks,
                                      containing the issued

                                      certificate chain from the signer (leaf and

                                      project them to separate files, your application
                                      code will need to

                                      additionally check that the leaf certificate

                        If a `Pod` has multiple `Port`s with the same name (which

                        be

                        generated.

                        The `Pod` must declare the specified `Port` in its spec or
                        the

                        target will be dropped by Prometheus.


                        This cannot be used to enable scraping of an undeclared port.

                        To scrape targets on a port which isn''t exposed, you need

                        duplicate targets if the `Pod` has other declared ports).

                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".


                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes
                      by the container runtime.

                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged
                      and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.


                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context`
                      mount option.

                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the
                      same SELinux label.

                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged
                      and unprivileged Pods.

                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes,
                      and all CSI volumes

                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount:
                      true in their

                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.

                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature
                      gate is enabled.


                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption"

                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology
                        and the global minimum.

                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.

                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and
                        pods with the same

                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:

                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3
                        to become 2/2/2;

                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1)

                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology

                        this value has no effect on scheduling.

                        equal to 1.

                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.

                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global
                        minimum" is treated as 0.

                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot

                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference.

                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup
                        will block containers from starting and may add significant

                        by the container image field.

                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath)
                        by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container
                        images.

                                  Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send
                                  a

                                  PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once
                                  the signer approves the

                                  request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet
                                  writes the key and

                                  certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod
                                  does not start until

                                  certificates have been issued for each podCertificate

                                  source in its spec.


                                  Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate
                                  at the time indicated

                                  by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt

                                  timestamp.


                                  Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the
                                  credentialBundlePath

                                  field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath
                                  and

                                  certificateChainPath fields.


                                  The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The
                                  first PEM

                                  entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and
                                  the remaining PEM

                                  entries are the certificate chain issued by the
                                  signer (typically,

                                  signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root
                                  order).


                                  Prefer using the credential bundle format, since
                                  your application code

                                  can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and
                                  certificateChainPath,

                                  your application must make two separate file reads.
                                  If these coincide

                                  with a certificate rotation, it is possible that
                                  the private key and leaf

                                  certificate you read may not correspond to each
                                  other.  Your application

                                  will need to check for this condition, and re-read
                                  until they are

                                  consistent.

                                      The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block,
                                      containing a PKCS#8 private

                                      key.


                                      The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks,
                                      containing the issued

          For each `Prometheus` resource, the Operator deploys one or several `StatefulSet`
          objects in the same namespace. The number of StatefulSets is equal to the
          number of shards which is 1 by default.


          The resource defines via label and namespace selectors which `ServiceMonitor`,
          `PodMonitor`, `Probe` and `PrometheusRule` objects should be associated
          to the deployed Prometheus instances.


          The Operator continuously reconciles the scrape and rules configuration
          and a sidecar container running in the Prometheus pods triggers a reload

                        This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field

                        Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the

                        this init container will be continually restarted on

                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all

                  By default, the sharding of targets is performed on:

                  Users can define their own sharding implementation by setting the

                  `__tmp_hash` label during the target discovery with relabeling

                  configuration (either in the monitoring resources or via scrape

                  You can also disable sharding on a specific target by setting the

                  `__tmp_disable_sharding` label with relabeling configuration. When

                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.

                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and
                        pods with the same

                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3
                        to become 2/2/2;

                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1)

                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology

                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.

                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global
                        minimum" is treated as 0.

                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot

                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses
                        a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if
                        the reference isn''t present.

                        on pod recreation.

                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup
                        will block containers from starting and may add significant

                        defined by the container runtime implementation on a host

                                  PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once
                                  the signer approves the

                                  request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet
                                  writes the key and

                                  certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod
                                  does not start until

                                  certificates have been issued for each podCertificate

                                  source in its spec.


                                  Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate
                                  at the time indicated

                                  timestamp.


                                  Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the
                                  credentialBundlePath

                                  field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath
                                  and

                                  certificateChainPath fields.


                                  The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The
                                  first PEM

                                  entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and
                                  the remaining PEM

                                  entries are the certificate chain issued by the
                                  signer (typically,

                                  signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root
                                  order).


                                  Prefer using the credential bundle format, since
                                  your application code

                                  can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and
                                  certificateChainPath,

                                  your application must make two separate file reads.
                                  If these coincide

                                  with a certificate rotation, it is possible that
                                  the private key and leaf

                                  certificate you read may not correspond to each
                                  other.  Your application

                                  will need to check for this condition, and re-read
                                  until they are

                                  consistent.

                                  use the certificates it issues.'

                                      Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When

                                      and certificateChainPath, your application needs
                                      to check that the key

                                      and leaf certificate are consistent, because
                                      it is possible to read the

                                      The credential bundle is a single file that
                                      contains multiple PEM blocks.

                                      The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block,
                                      containing a PKCS#8 private

                                      key.


                                      The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks,
                                      containing the issued

                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes
                      by the container runtime.

                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged
                      and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.


                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context`
                      mount option.

                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the
                      same SELinux label.

                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged
                      and unprivileged Pods.

                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes,

                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount:
                      true in their

                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.

                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature

                        pods with the same

                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:

                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |

                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |

                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3
                        to become 2/2/2;

                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1)
                        on zone1(zone2)

                        violate MaxSkew(1).

                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any
                        zone.

                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology

                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then
                        the calculation of Skew is performed.

                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology

                        this value has no effect on scheduling.

                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than

                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is
                        equal to 1.

                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.

                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global
                        minimum" is treated as 0.

                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot
